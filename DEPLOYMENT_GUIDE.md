# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Set Up

1. **Pinch-to-Zoom Feature**: Two-finger pinch gestures now work on touch devices
2. **Vite Configuration**: Updated `vite.config.ts` with the correct base path
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automatic deployment configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
4. **Build System**: Tested and confirmed working
5. **.gitignore**: Added to exclude node_modules and build files

## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Add pinch-to-zoom and GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/[your-username]/CongressionalAppChallenge`
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down and click on **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow called "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
4. Once complete, you'll see a green checkmark ‚úì

### Step 4: Access Your App

Your app will be live at:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/CongressionalAppChallenge/
```

Replace `[your-username]` with your actual GitHub username.

## üîÑ Future Updates

Every time you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Build your app
2. Deploy it to GitHub Pages
3. Make it live within 1-2 minutes

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Locally

To test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the build
npm run preview
```

## üì± Touch Features

The app now supports full touch controls:

**Touch Devices:**
- **Single-finger drag**: Pan/move around the canvas
- **Two-finger pinch**: Zoom in/out
- **Two-finger drag**: Pan while zooming

**Desktop:**
- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom
- **Ctrl/Cmd +/-**: Keyboard zoom shortcuts
- **Space + drag**: Pan the canvas
- **Middle mouse drag**: Alternative pan method

## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Files

- **vite.config.ts**: Contains the base path `/CongressionalAppChallenge/`
- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**: GitHub Actions deployment configuration
- **.gitignore**: Excludes node_modules and build files from Git

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: App shows blank page after deployment
- **Solution**: Make sure the repository name matches the base path in `vite.config.ts`
- If you renamed your repo, update line 8 in `vite.config.ts`:
  ```typescript
  base: '/YourNewRepoName/',
  ```

### Issue: GitHub Actions workflow fails
- **Solution**: Check the Actions tab for error details
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with source set to "GitHub Actions"
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Issue: Changes not showing up
- **Solution**: Clear browser cache or open in incognito mode
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update after deployment

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Actions tab for build logs
2. Verify the base path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repo name
3. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as the source

## üéâ Success Checklist

- [ ] Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Pages enabled with "GitHub Actions" source
- [ ] Workflow completed successfully in Actions tab
- [ ] App accessible at `https://[username].github.io/CongressionalAppChallenge/`
- [ ] Pinch-to-zoom works on mobile devices
- [ ] All features working as expected
